            <p>This project’s goal is to build a controller for my house’s air exchanger
            that will optimize its utilization. It will take into account exterior and
            interior temperature and humidity to decide what the exchanger should do. In
            a second time I will add a web/phone interface to access and set the
            controller. In fact, I have a lot of other ideas and goals, but better to not
            make too many promises!</p><!-- TEASER_END -->

            <div class="section" id="the-problem-and-the-current-situation">
              <h2>The problem and the current situation</h2>

              <p>I suffer from strong allergies so, a few years ago, I added to my house
              an air exchanger with <a class="reference external" href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a> filter, a <a class=
              "reference external" href=
              "http://www.venmar.ca/61-air-exchangers-thh-1-0.html">Venmar/VanEE THH
              1.0</a>, to purify the inside air. Unfortunately the controllers that can
              work with this model are really limited (completely manual with only theses
              modes stop/slow/fast/recycle) or more targeted at managing the relative
              humidity. Not to mention that they are all pretty ugly. I really don’t have
              any difficulties to understand why <a class="reference external" href=
              "http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/14/2559567/tony-fadell-nest-learning-thermostat">
              Tony Fadell created the Nest thermostat</a>!</p>

              <p>What is needed for an exchanger targeted at purifying the air is to run
              it just enough to replace all the house’s air every day and maintaining a
              good humidity level at the same time. Not too dry in winter, not too humid
              in summer.</p>

              <blockquote>
                In fact, a human at rest will <em>consume</em> around 400 cubic feet of
                air a day (0.27 CFM). We are 5 humans living in my house. Running the
                exchanger at slow speed (45 CFM) at least 45 min. each day should exit
                all the C02 we have created. It takes 12 hours at this speed to change
                all the house’s air volume (30 000 cu ft). So, if I change all house’s
                air every day, CO2 level should be kept low enough. At the beginning I
                was thinking about hooking also a CO2 meter to my controller but, with
                these facts, I think I just need to set my controller to run the
                exchanger at least 45 min. a day from exterior air and all will be fine
                on the CO2 side (I know that my calculations don’t take in account some
                variables…).
              </blockquote>

              <p>My current solution is to use my costly <a class="reference external"
              href=
              "http://www.aubetech.com/products/produitsDetails.php?noProduit=158&amp;noLangue=2">
              Aube thermostat</a> (TH146-P-U) that control my heating system and set it
              to control also the exchanger. I can set it to run the exchanger at a
              minimum of <em>x</em> minutes every hour and to run it more if there’s to
              much humidity. But it’s not possible to choose the fan speed, it’s always
              at slow. I can neither control the recycling mode.</p>

              <p>Connecting the exchanger to this thermostat was not easy. There’s no
              information on the 4 wires coming out from the exchanger (I called directly
              the manufacturer to ask for information but without success). These 4 wires
              come from a micro-controller on the exchanger board. I did some
              investigations and found that when 2 of the 4 wires are connected together
              the exchanger stop. So I added a relay between the thermostat relay and the
              exchanger to reverse the relay action. Unfortunately, with this setup, if I
              want to run the exchanger at full speed I still need to go in the basement
              and turn the button on the machine.</p>

              <p>About a year after I did this set up, our house had a significant water
              infiltration that probably affected the exchanger. After this event the
              full speed was not working anymore. But I didn’t use the full speed really
              often so I can’t be sure if it’s the water or how I wired the controller
              that did the harm. But I know that the problem is definitely in the
              micro-controller. All the rest of the board is working properly.</p>

              <p>So, this left me with two options:</p>

              <ul class="simple">
                <li>Change the exchanger board for around 150$ and keep my current
                setup.</li>

                <li>Keep the old board and hook it to a custom controller that will
                fulfill my needs better that my current setup.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>I choose the second option.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="choosing-the-controller-hardware">
              <h2>Choosing the controller hardware</h2>

              <p>The first time I heard about the <a class="reference external" href=
              "http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> I immediately saw that was
              the perfect fit for my controller project. It would be easy for me to
              program the controller in Python, create a Phone interface by running a web
              server and interface it with the exchanger and some sensors with the GPIO.
              So, I bought one.</p>

              <p>Just after buying it I stumbled on the <a class="reference external"
              href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone
              Black</a> and it definitely look like another really good candidate for my
              project. The price is mostly the same (45$ for the BBB vs 35$ for RPi, but
              you need to buy an SD card for the later). Some advantages of the BBB are
              more IO (some analogs!) and a faster CPU. Having flash memory instead of
              the SD card can be an advantage or disadvantage, it depends of the use. For
              me, it doesn’t really matter. Some disadvantages are a less powerful video
              output (it doesn’t matter for my project, there’s no display) and a smaller
              community. <em>Makezine</em> did a more <a class="reference external" href=
              "http://makezine.com/magazine/how-to-choose-the-right-platform-raspberry-pi-or-beaglebone-black/">
              thoughtful comparison</a>.</p>

              <p>In my case a micro-controller, like the <a class="reference external"
              href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, is not a good match because I
              need to be able to run a web server. I found only a few micro-controllers
              that can run a web server like the <a class="reference external" href=
              "http://www.atmel.ca/devices/ATMEGA88.aspx">Atmega88</a>, but the learning
              curve and complexity is a big disadvantage for no apparent advantage in
              return in my case.</p>

                <h3>Choosing a Linux distribution</h3>

                <p>There are <a class="reference external" href=

                the Raspberry Pi. I chooses <a class="reference external" href=
                "http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2">
                Occidentalis 0.2</a> from <a class="reference external" href=
                "http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>. It’s derived from <a class=
                "reference external" href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a>. For me
                the good things about Occidentalis are:</p>

                <ul class="simple">
                  <li>Like Raspbian, it’s based on Debian, my preferred Linux
                  distro.</li>

                  <li>Unlike Raspbian, the SSH daemon is already activated.</li>

                  <li>The <a class="reference external" href=
                  "http://avahi.org/wiki/AboutAvahi">avahi</a> daemon is also already
                  activated (Bonjour client).</li>

                  <li>Many IO kernel modules are included.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The most important things for me are SSH and Bonjour. I don’t have any
                display that I can plug to the RPi, so I need to be able to do everything
                via SSH from the beginning. With Bonjour I don’t have to find/guess its
                IP address, I can just connect to <em>raspberrypi.local</em>.</p>

                <h3>Installing the distro</h3>

                <p>I used a Mac to install the distro on the SD card. I followed these

                <p>The SD card partition will be the same size as the distro image size
                instead of the card size. It’s a good idea to expand the root partition
                to fill the SD card. It’s easy to do by choosing the
                <em>expand_rootfs</em> menu option of the <a class="reference external"

                <p>I think it’s good idea to upgrade the OS:</p>

<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get update

                <h3>Adjusting the memory</h3>

                <p>There are two things to adjust (at least in my case):</p>

                <ol class="arabic simple">
                  <li>By default my RPi was using only 256 MB of the 512 MB. I had to
                  upgrade the firmware to access all the memory:</li>
                </ol>
                <pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo rpi-update
</pre>

                <ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
                  <li>Some memory is used by the GPU. It’s possible to change how much
                  memory the GPU will use. In my case, as I will not use an external
                  display, I set it to the minimum:</li>
                </ol>
                <pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo raspi-config
</pre>

                <p>Then choose the <em>Memory Split</em> option in the <em>Advanced
                Options</em> option. I set the GPU memory to 16 MB, which is the
                minimum.</p>

                <p>It’s also possible to <a class="reference external" href=
                "http://elinux.org/RPiconfig#Memory">set the memory to be split
                dynamically (CMA)</a>.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="section" id="connecting-it-directly-to-a-mac">
                <h3>Connecting it directly to a Mac</h3>

                <p>As I use the Occidentalis distro, I simply have to connect like
                this:</p>
                <pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="nv">$ </span>ssh pi@rasbpberrypi.local
</pre>

                <p>Unfortunately I don’t have a WiFi dongle on my RPi and my router is
                far from my main computer. But I would like to have the RPi sitting next
                to my main computer to ease development. A solution is to connect the
                Ethernet cable directly in my Mac and share the Mac Internet (WiFi)
                connection. By sharing the Internet connection, the Mac will create a
                subnet on 192.168.2.x and will assign dynamically an address to the RPi.
                So, by sharing the Internet connection, you get two things: a subnet with
                an address for the RPi so you can now connect to the RPi from your Mac,
                and Internet access to the RPi. No need to turn on IPV6 on the RPi or to
                install <em>avahi-autoipd</em>, as others suggested.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately that did not work for me on the first try and many tries
                after, until I realized that my LAN was already using the 192.168.2.x
                subnet! I switched my LAN to another subnet and everything started to
                work. If you can’t change the LAN subnet, another solution is to

                <p>I also installed vim because vim.tiny, installed by default, lacks too
                many features:</p>
                <pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install vim
</pre>

                <p>That’s enough for now. Next time I will write about reading the
                sensors and controlling the relays.</p>
