If you want to extract the text content of a Word file there are a few `solutions <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42482/best-way-to-extract-text-from-a-word-doc-without-using-com-automation>`_ to do this in Python. Unfortunately most of these solutions have dependencies or need to run an external command in a subprocess or are heavy/complex, using an office suite, etc. I find that the best solution among those in the Stackoverflow page is `python-docx <https://github.com/mikemaccana/python-docx>`_. But using it bring two dependencies: *python-docx* itself and `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_. Installing *python-docx* is not a big problem. Unfortunately *lxml* is sometimes hard to install or, at the minimum, requires compilation.

To avoid that, inspired by *python-docx*, I created a simple function to extract text from *.docx* files that do not require dependencies, using only the standard library. So itâ€™s easy to incorporate it in any Python project.

Is there any way to improve it?
